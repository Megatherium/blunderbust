# Agent Instructions
## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context (MANDATORY!), or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

If there's any contradiction: `bd prime` is right. AGENTS.md is not 100% up to date.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session** before sayind "done" or "complete", you MUST complete ALL steps below.
Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.
Push is not allowed until the work is REVIEWED

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
Phase 1:
  1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
  2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
  3. **Run CODE REVIEW & REFINEMENT PROTOCOL** - See `bd prime` for details
Phase 2 (after SOMEONE ELSE has reviewed it):
  4. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
  5. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
    ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    git add (careful with using -A, the user sometimes leaves untracked crap lying around) && git commit ...
    git push
    git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
    ```
  6. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
  7. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
  8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- **ALL bd operations BEFORE any git operations** - bd sync first, then git add/commit/push
- Failure to follow this order creates double commits (one for code, one for .beads/issues.jsonl)
- MODIFY ticket, bd SYNC, git STAGE/PUSH - else you will be creating extra commits

## Lessons learned

- Be aware of Go's pass-by semantics especially with closures.
- Don't assume you know what a function does by its name alone. The devil is in the details.
- In Bubble Tea, never mutate application state (like maps or UI models) inside a `tea.Cmd` background goroutine; always return a `tea.Msg` and mutate state safely within the main `Update()` thread.
- Never use defer cancel() on a context passed to Dial if the returned connection will use that context after the function returns - always use a separate dial context with its own timeout.
- teatest strips ANSI color codes, making it fundamentally incapable of testing visual focus states - navigation tests belong in agent_tui_test.go where websocket streaming preserves ANSI codes.
- Delete tests that simulate actions but only verify trivial assertions - vacuous tests like assert.True(t, len(out) > 0) provide false confidence and should be removed entirely.
- WaitFor is for observable state changes, not for timing delays - use time.Sleep for rapid key sequences where intermediate states don't produce detectable output differences.
- When the reviewer says "this is completely untouched," stop and actually look at the exact line they're pointing to
- Adding visible text indicators to UI (like ▶ for focus) is valuable for users even when your testing framework can't leverage them - don't conflate UI improvements with testability.
- A 3.0/10 review score means you fundamentally misunderstood the requirements - don't try to justify partial fixes, just implement exactly what the reviewer specified.

## Modern tooling

All kinds of modern replacements for standard shell tools are available: rg, fd, sd, choose, hck
The interface is nicer for humans. You pick whatever feels right for you.

## File Editing Strategy

- **Use the Right Tool for the Job**: For any non-trivial file modifications, you **must** use the advanced editing tools provided by the MCP server.
  - **Simple Edits**: Use `sed` or `write_file` only for simple, unambiguous, single-line changes or whole-file creation.
  - **Complex Edits**: For multi-line changes, refactoring, or context-aware modifications, use `edit_file` (or equivalent diff-based tool) to minimize regression risks.

## Commit Messages

- **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages **must** adhere to the Conventional Commits specification.
  - **Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  - **Example**: `feat(harvester): implement reverse-scroll logic for Gemini`
  - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`
- **Beads extra**: Add a line like "Affected ticket(s): bb-foo", can be multiple with e.g. review tickets
- **WARNING**: Forgetting the ticket reference line is a commit message format violation. Double-check before committing.

## Documentation

- **New Features**: When implementing new features, **must** update documentation:
  - User-facing features: Update README.md with usage examples
  - Behavioral changes: Update AGENTS.md to inform agents
  - Always keep both files in sync

## Reference Material (Mandatory When Relevant)

Before working in these areas, you MUST read the corresponding reference file:

- **TUI Testing** → `agent-docs/tui_testing_guide.md`
  - Modifying or testing TUI components (`internal/ui/`)
  - Writing or debugging `agent-tui` tests
  - Making visual changes that require color/focus state verification

- **Build & Run** → `agent-docs/build_and_run.md`
  - Building the project (make/build commands)
  - Running bdb locally
  - Configuring CI/CD pipelines
  - Adding new CLI flags or exit codes

- **Dolt Internals** → `agent-docs/dolt_internals.md`
  - Modifying `internal/data/dolt/`
  - Working on ticket store implementations
  - Debugging database connection issues

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
