Blunderbuss NEVER writes to the beads DB.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### internal/data/dolt/embedded.go\n- newEmbeddedStore(ctx, beadsDir) — opens embedded Dolt connection\n- Read .beads/metadata.json to get database name\n- DSN: file://\u003cabs_path_to_.beads/dolt\u003e?database=\u003cdb_name\u003e (read-only, no committer needed)\n- Connection pool: MaxOpenConns=1, MaxIdleConns=1 (embedded is single-connection)\n- Implements TicketStore.ListTickets using ready_issues view\n\n### internal/data/dolt/server.go\n- newServerStore(ctx, beadsDir) — opens MySQL connection to Dolt server\n- Read .beads/metadata.json for host, port, user, database\n- Standard MySQL DSN\n- Implements TicketStore.ListTickets using ready_issues view\n\n### internal/data/dolt/store.go\n- NewStore(ctx, beadsDir) — factory that reads metadata.json, picks embedded vs server mode\n- Shared query logic (both modes use same SQL, different *sql.DB)\n- ListTickets query: SELECT from ready_issues view, map to domain.Ticket\n- Filter support: status, issue_type, search (LIKE on title), limit\n\n### Metadata parsing\n- Parse .beads/metadata.json to determine mode (check dolt_mode or presence of server fields)\n- Current project's metadata.json: {database: dolt, backend: dolt, dolt_database: beads_bb} → embedded\n- Server example: adds dolt_mode: server, dolt_server_host, dolt_server_port, dolt_server_user\n\n### Unit tests\n- Metadata parsing (embedded detection, server detection)\n- Query building with filters\n- Use sqlmock for query tests (don't require running Dolt)\n\n### CLI integration\n- --beads-dir flag (default: .beads in current directory) to locate the beads database\n- DSN override via --dsn flag for manual connection strings\n\n## Key decisions\n- Read-only: no writes, no transactions, no locking concerns\n- Use ready_issues view for the default list (shows only unblocked, non-deferred, non-ephemeral)\n- Embedded mode requires CGO (dolthub/driver uses CGO) — document this in README\n- Fail loudly with actionable errors: DB not found, connection refused, schema mismatch\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-2p9","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Implement TicketStore: Dolt embedded + MySQL server backends","updated_at":"2026-02-20T08:14:25Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Here is the high-level architecture:\n#### 1. The Data Layer (Beads/Dolt)\nWe need to interface with the Dolt database used by Beads. Since Dolt is MySQL-compatible, we will use a standard Go SQL driver to query for:\n* **Tickets/Issues:** The active tasks you want to work on.\n* **Metadata:** Contextual info that might need to be passed to the harness (branch names, repo paths).\n#### 2. The Model Layer (Configuration)\nSince harnesses (OpenCode, Claude, etc.) change frequently, we should define them in a `config.yaml` or `config.json`. This maps a \"Harness\" to a specific shell command template.\nThe TicketID will be used in a work prompt,\n* **Attributes:** Name, Command Template (e.g., `opencode --model {{.Model}} --agent {{.Agent}}`), and supported Models/Agents.\n#### 3. The UI Layer (Bubble Tea)\nA multi-step TUI flow:\n* **List View:** Select a Ticket (filtered from Beads).\n* **Selection View:** Select Harness -\u003e Select Model -\u003e Select Agent (if applicable).\n* **Execution:** Confirm and Launch.\n#### 4. The Execution Layer (tmux/OS)\nThe Go binary will not just \"run\" a command; it will spawn a `tmux` window or pane.\n* **Command:** `tmux new-window -n \"Ticket-123\" \"harness_cmd_here\"`\n* **Tracking:** We can capture the window ID or PID if we want to monitor the process status later.\n---\n### Implementation Plan: Phase 1\nWe should start with a \"Minimum Viable Launcher\" that reads from the Dolt DB and triggers a tmux window.\n## Feature Description\nKeep this code nicely maintainable and extensible.

When changes are detected, trigger a UI refresh.\n\nPros:\n- Simple to implement\n- Works across all platforms\n\nCons:\n- May trigger too frequently during batch operations\n- Need debouncing logic\n\n### Option 2: Dolt Event Stream\nIf Dolt supports events/notifications, subscribe to changes at the database level.\n\nPros:\n- More precise - only reacts to actual data changes\n- Less filesystem overhead\n\nCons:\n- Depends on Dolt capabilities\n- May require polling if no native event support\n\n### Option 3: IPC/Signal from bd CLI\nWhen Issues chained together like beads. A lightweight issue tracker with first-class dependency support.\n\nUsage:\n  bd [flags]\n  bd [command]\n\nMaintenance:\n  rename-prefix    Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the

When launching an agent, the output capture starts but never receives any data.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Agent launches successfully\n- OutputCapture is created and Start() is called\n- Temp file is created\n- pipe-pane command executes without error\n- Output view shows 'Waiting for output...' indefinitely\n- No output is ever captured\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Agent output should be streamed to the temp file via pipe-pane\n- Output should appear in the agent view when selecting the agent\n\n## Implementation Details\nLocated in: internal/exec/tmux/capture.go\n\nThe capture uses:\n```go\npipeCmd := fmt.Sprintf('cat \u003e\u003e %s', tempFile.Name())\n_, err = c.runner.Run(ctx, 'tmux', 'pipe-pane', '-t', c.windowID, pipeCmd)\n```\n\n## Potential Root Causes\n1. **Window target issue**: Window ID might not be valid/resolvable when pipe-pane runs\n   - Currently falls back to window name if ID is empty\n   - May need to use different target format (@N vs window name)\n\n2. **Tmux version differences**: Different tmux versions handle pipe-pane differently\n   - Some versions may require -I flag\n   - Target syntax might vary\n\n3. **Shell escaping**: The 'cat \u003e\u003e file' command might need different quoting\n   - Special characters in file path could break the command\n   - May need to wrap in shell invocation\n\n4. **Timing issue**: pipe-pane might run before window is fully ready\n   - Could add a small delay after window creation\n   - Or retry mechanism\n\n5. **Target window not active**: pipe-pane might only work on active/visible panes\n   - Check if window needs to be selected first\n   - Try using pane ID instead of window ID\n\n## Debugging Steps\n1. Add logging to see exact tmux command being run\n2. Verify window ID format (should be like @1, @2, etc.)\n3. Test pipe-pane manually: tmux pipe-pane -t @1 'cat \u003e\u003e /tmp/test.log'\n4. Check if file permissions are correct\n5.

Add Animation State to UIModel\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_types.go`**\n\nAdd new struct and field to UIModel:\n\n```go\ntype AnimationState struct {\n    pulsePhase      float64       // 0-1, sine wave for breathing (2-3 second period)\n    startTime       time.Time      // When animation started\n}\n\ntype UIModel struct {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n\n    // Animation state\n    animState       AnimationState\n}\n```\n\nInitialize in NewUIModel:\n```go\nreturn UIModel{\n    // ... existing initialization ...\n    animState: AnimationState{\n        startTime: time.Now(),\n    },\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Create Animation Tick Command\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_messages.go`** (or add to existing file)\n\nDefine message and command:\n\n```go\n// animationTickMsg is sent periodically to update animations\ntype animationTickMsg struct {\n    time time.Time\n}\n\n// animationTickCmd returns a command that sends animationTickMsg every 16ms (~60fps)\nfunc animationTickCmd() tea.Cmd {\n    return tea.Tick(16*time.Millisecond, func(t time.Time) tea.Msg {\n        return animationTickMsg{time: t}\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Handle Animation in Update Loop\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_update.go`**\n\nAdd handler in Update method:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {\n    var cmd tea.Cmd\n\n    switch msg := msg.(type) {\n    // ... existing cases ...\n\n    case animationTickMsg:\n        return m.handleAnimationTick(msg)\n\n    // ... rest of cases ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nImplement handler:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) handleAnimationTick(msg animationTickMsg) (UIModel, tea.Cmd) {\n    elapsed := msg.time.Sub(m.animState.startTime).Seconds()\n\n    // Pulse cycle: 0 to 1 to 0 over 2.5 seconds (2.5 second period)\n    // Using sine wave: sin(2π * t / period)\n    period := 2.5\n    phase := (math.Sin(2*math.Pi*elapsed/period) + 1) / 2 // Normalize to 0-1\n\n    m.animState.pulsePhase = phase\n\n    return m, nil\n}\n```\n\nImport `math` package.\n\n### 4. Initialize Animation Loop\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model.go`**\n\nModify Init to start animation:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) Init() tea.Cmd {\n    return tea.Batch(\n        func() tea.Msg {\n            if err := m.app.Registry.Load(context.Background()); err != nil {\n                return warningMsg{err: fmt.Errorf(\"model discovery load failed: %w\", err)}\n            }\n            return registryLoadedMsg{}\n        },\n        func() tea.Msg {\n            store, err := m.app.CreateStore(context.Background())\n            if err != nil {\n                return errMsg{err}\n            }\n            tickets, err := store.ListTickets(context.Background(), data.TicketFilter{})\n            if err != nil {\n                return errMsg{err}\n            }\n            return ticketsLoadedMsg(tickets)\n        },\n        discoverWorktreesCmd(m.app.opts.BeadsDir),\n        animationTickCmd(), // Start animation loop\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Pulsing Border Colors\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_view.go`**\n\nAdd helper function to compute pulsing color:\n\n```go\n// getPulsingColor returns a color that varies based on pulse phase\n// For ThemeActive (currently 205), vary brightness slightly\nfunc getPulsingColor(phase float64) lipgloss.Color {\n    // Phase: 0-1, with 0.5 being brightest\n    // We want subtle variation: +/- 15 brightness units\n\n    baseColor := ThemeActive\n    // Assuming baseColor is AdaptiveColor, convert to hex for manipulation\n    // For simplicity, use static palette with interpolation\n\n    // Subtle variation: dark (235) to bright (201) magenta\n    dark := lipgloss.Color(\"235\")\n    bright := lipgloss.Color(\"201\")\n    base := lipgloss.Color(\"219\") // Standard magenta-ish\n\n    // Linear interpolation\n    if phase \u003c 0.5 {\n        // Going from dark to base\n        t := phase * 2 // 0 to 1\n        return interpolateColor(dark, base, t)\n    } else {\n        // Going from base to bright\n        t := (phase - 0.5) * 2 // 0 to 1\n        return interpolateColor(base, bright, t)\n    }\n}\n\n// interpolateColor blends between two colors\nfunc interpolateColor(c1, c2 lipgloss.Color, t float64) lipgloss.Color {\n    // Simple implementation: return c1 or c2 based on t\n    // For proper implementation, parse hex and interpolate RGB\n    // For now, use discrete steps\n    if t \u003c 0.33 {\n        return c1\n    } else if t \u003c 0.66 {\n        return lipgloss.Color(\"219\") // Middle\n    } else {\n        return c2\n    }\n}\n```\n\nModify renderMatrixView to use pulsing colors:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) renderMatrixView() string {\n    // ... existing guards ...\n\n    // Get pulsing color based on animation phase\n    pulsingActiveColor := getPulsingColor(m.animState.pulsePhase)\n\n    activeBorder := func(w int) lipgloss.Style {\n        if w \u003c 2 {\n            w = 2\n        }\n        return lipgloss.NewStyle().\n            Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n            BorderForeground(pulsingActiveColor). // Use pulsing color\n            Width(w - 2).\n            Height(listHeight - 2)\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of renderMatrixView unchanged ...\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Add Import Statements\n\n**Files requiring updates:**\n\n`internal/ui/model_update.go`:\n```go\nimport (\n    // ... existing imports ...\n    \"math\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n```\n\n`internal/ui/model_messages.go`:\n```go\nimport (\n    \"time\"\n    tea \"github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea\"\n)\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Animation state properly initialized in UIModel\n- [ ] Animation tick loop starts on Init and runs continuously\n- [ ] Focused column border color pulses smoothly (2.5 second cycle)\n- [ ] Pulse is subtle, not distracting\n- [ ] No performance degradation (maintains ~60fps)\n- [ ] All existing functionality remains unchanged\n- [ ] Tests pass\n\n## Notes\n\n- The pulse should be subtle: users shouldn't notice it consciously, but should feel the UI is \"alive\"\n- Color interpolation can be improved later with proper RGB blending (simple version is fine for now)\n- Animation loop runs at ~60fps but can throttle if performance is an issue\n- This is the foundation for all other arcade effects\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: bb-cj8 (parent task for overall visual polish)\n\n## Blocks\n\n- Lock-in flash implementation (needs animation foundation)\n- Color cycling effects (needs animation foundation)\n- Glow effects (needs animation foundation)\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-av2","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":3,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Animation Foundation \u0026 Core Pulse","updated_at":"2026-03-01T09:31:18Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

This will cause runtime query failures.\n\n**Current (broken):**\n```go\nif filter.Status != \"\" {\n    sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\" AND status = $%d\", argIdx))\n    args = append(args, filter.Status)\n    argIdx++\n}\n```\n\n**Should be:**\n```go\nif filter.Status != \"\" {\n    sb.WriteString(\" AND status = ?\")\n    args = append(args, filter.Status)\n}\n```\n\nThe argIdx variable and tracking is unnecessary with ? placeholders - just remove it entirely.\n\n**Files to update:**\n- store.go: Remove argIdx, change all $N to ?\n- store_test.go: Update all regex expectations from \\$1, \\$2 etc to just ?\n\n### 2. MEDIUM: Password escaping in DSN (server.go:84-88)\nPassword from BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD env var is not escaped before being included in DSN string. If password contains special characters (@, :, /, spaces), the DSN will be malformed and connection will fail.\n\n```go\n// Current - unsafe for passwords with special chars\nif password != \"\" {\n    dsn = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%s@tcp(%s:%d)/%s\", user, password, host, port, database)\n}\n```\n\n**Fix options:**\n1. Use mysql.Config struct and FormatDSN() method\n2. Use net/url.UserPassword() and escape the password\n3. At minimum, document that passwords must not contain special chars\n\n### 3. MINOR: Missing test coverage\n- No test for Close() idempotency (calling Close twice should not error)\n- No test for double-close safety\n- No test for store.Close() returning error from db.Close()\n\n### 4. MINOR: Unused beadsDir parameter (server.go:21)\nThe newServerStore function has beadsDir parameter but doesn't use it (marked with _). This is intentional since server mode doesn't need local path, but worth a brief comment explaining why.\n\n### 5. COSMETIC: Duplicate package doc (doc.go vs store.go)\nBoth doc.go and store.go have package-level documentation. Consider consolidating - typically doc.go is the canonical place for package docs.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All SQL queries use ? placeholders (MySQL style)\n- Tests updated to expect ? placeholders in regex\n- All tests pass\n- Password handling is safe or documented limitation\n- Code compiles without warnings","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-hdm","is_template":0,"issue_type":"bug","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":0,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Refinement: Fix SQL placeholder format in Dolt Store","updated_at":"2026-02-20T08:14:07Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

When the function returns, the context is cancelled, and the returned connection is using a cancelled context. This must be fixed. Do not defer the cancel of the context passed to Dial if the connection is going to be used outside the function block. Example fix:\n\n```go\nfunc connectWebsocket(t *testing.T, wsURL string) *websocket.Conn {\n\tt.Helper()\n\tctx := context.Background() // Use Background for the ongoing connection\n\tdialCtx, dialCancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, wsTimeout)\n\tdefer dialCancel()\n\tu, err := url.Parse(wsURL)\n\trequire.NoError(t, err)\n\tconn, _, err := websocket.Dial(dialCtx, u.String(), nil)\n\trequire.NoError(t, err)\n\treturn conn\n}\n```\n\n2. **Navigation tests still contain vacuous assertions**\nAdding `assert.True(t, len(out) \u003e 0 || len(initialOutput) \u003e 0)` in `teatest_test.go` does not test navigation. It just tests that the terminal isn't completely empty, which is already true before the keys are even pressed.\nWhile the comments correctly point out that plain-text string output might not visibly change on focus (if only colors change), that means teatest (which only sees plain text) is the WRONG tool for testing focus navigation.\nTo fix this:\nIf teatest cannot verify focus changes because they are only represented via visual styling (ANSI colors) that teatest strips, then these tests should be moved to `agent_tui_test.go` (where websocket stream ANSI parsing is available) OR the TUI model should provide a readable string representation of its state (like an indicator \"\u003e\") that teatest can observe.\nDo NOT leave tests that simulate actions but verify nothing.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-k56","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Refinement: TUI Automated Testing (bb-2id) -- round 3","updated_at":"2026-02-28T12:42:14Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Enhance Color Interpolation System\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_view.go`**\n\nReplace simple interpolateColor with proper RGB blending:\n\n```go\n// parseHexColor parses hex color string to RGB\nfunc parseHexColor(c string) (uint8, uint8, uint8, error) {\n    // Handle AdaptiveColor - for now, just extract hex\n    // AdaptiveColor{Light: \"230\", Dark: \"230\"} -\u003e \"230\"\n    // In practice, we'll use direct hex colors\n\n    var r, g, b uint8\n    _, err := fmt.Sscanf(c, \"#%02x%02x%02x\", \u0026r, \u0026g, \u0026b)\n    if err != nil {\n        // Try without # prefix\n        _, err = fmt.Sscanf(c, \"%02x%02x%02x\", \u0026r, \u0026g, \u0026b)\n        if err != nil {\n            // Fallback to ANSI color codes - return default\n            return 200, 200, 200, err\n        }\n    }\n    return r, g, b, nil\n}\n\n// interpolateColor blends between two RGB colors\nfunc interpolateColor(c1, c2 lipgloss.Color, t float64) lipgloss.Color {\n    // If both are the same, return one\n    if c1 == c2 || t \u003c= 0 {\n        return c1\n    }\n    if t \u003e= 1 {\n        return c2\n    }\n\n    // Parse colors\n    r1, g1, b1, _ := parseHexColor(string(c1))\n    r2, g2, b2, _ := parseHexColor(string(c2))\n\n    // Linear interpolation\n    r := uint8(float64(r1) + (float64(r2)-float64(r1))*t)\n    g := uint8(float64(g1) + (float64(g2)-float64(g1))*t)\n    b := uint8(float64(b1) + (float64(b2)-float64(b1))*t)\n\n    // Format back to hex\n    return lipgloss.Color(fmt.Sprintf(\"#%02x%02x%02x\", r, g, b))\n}\n```\n\nUpdate getPulsingColor with proper interpolation:\n\n```go\nfunc getPulsingColor(phase float64) lipgloss.Color {\n    // Palette: dark magenta -\u003e standard -\u003e bright magenta\n    dark := lipgloss.Color(\"#996699\")   // Dark purple-magenta\n    base := lipgloss.Color(\"#d700d7\")   // Standard magenta\n    bright := lipgloss.Color(\"#ff66ff\")  // Bright pink-magenta\n\n    if phase \u003c 0.5 {\n        t := phase * 2 // 0 to 1\n        return interpolateColor(dark, base, t)\n    } else {\n        t := (phase - 0.5) * 2 // 0 to 1\n        return interpolateColor(base, bright, t)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add Color Cycling System\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_types.go`**\n\nExtend AnimationState:\n\n```go\ntype AnimationState struct {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n\n    // Color cycling\n    colorCycleIndex   int\n    colorCycleStart   time.Time\n}\n\n// Color palette for cycling\nvar colorPalette = []lipgloss.Color{\n    lipgloss.Color(\"#d700d7\"), // Magenta\n    lipgloss.Color(\"#8a2be2\"), // Blue-violet\n    lipgloss.Color(\"#ff6b6b\"), // Coral red\n    lipgloss.Color(\"#4ecdc4\"), // Teal\n}\n```\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_update.go`**\n\nAdd cycling in handleAnimationTick:\n\n```go\n// In handleAnimationTick\n// Color cycling: change palette every 8 seconds\ncycleElapsed := msg.time.Sub(m.animState.colorCycleStart).Seconds()\ncycleDuration := 8.0\n\nif cycleElapsed \u003e= cycleDuration {\n    m.animState.colorCycleIndex = (m.animState.colorCycleIndex + 1) % len(colorPalette)\n    m.animState.colorCycleStart = msg.time\n}\n```\n\nUpdate getPulsingColor to use cycling palette:\n\n```go\nfunc getPulsingColor(phase float64, paletteIndex int) lipgloss.Color {\n    // Get current base color from cycling palette\n    baseColor := colorPalette[paletteIndex]\n\n    // Create dark and bright variants based on base\n    // For simplicity, use fixed palette in function\n    dark := lipgloss.Color(\"#996699\")\n    bright := lipgloss.Color(\"#ff66ff\")\n\n    // For a more sophisticated system, would generate variants from baseColor\n    // by darkening/lightening the RGB values\n\n    if phase \u003c 0.5 {\n        t := phase * 2\n        return interpolateColor(dark, baseColor, t)\n    } else {\n        t := (phase - 0.5) * 2\n        return interpolateColor(baseColor, bright, t)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate renderMatrixView to pass palette index:\n\n```go\npulsingActiveColor := getPulsingColor(m.animState.pulsePhase, m.animState.colorCycleIndex)\n```\n\nInitialize colorCycleStart in NewUIModel:\n\n```go\nanimState: AnimationState{\n    startTime:       time.Now(),\n    colorCycleStart: time.Now(),\n},\n```\n\n### 3. Implement Glow Effects (Multi-Layer Borders)\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_view.go`**\n\nAdd glow rendering helper:\n\n```go\n// renderGlowBorder creates a multi-layer border with glow effect\nfunc renderGlowBorder(w int, activeColor lipgloss.Color) string {\n    if w \u003c 4 {\n        return \"\" // Not enough space for glow\n    }\n\n    // Outer layer (dimmer)\n    outerStyle := lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n        BorderForeground(activeColor).\n        Width(w - 2)\n\n    // Inner layer (brighter)\n    innerStyle := lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n        BorderForeground(lipgloss.Color(\"#ffffff\")). // Bright white/gray\n        Width(w - 4)\n\n    // Since we can't nest lipgloss styles directly, simulate with\n    // layered rendering using border characters\n    // For now, use simpler approach: single border with brighter foreground\n\n    return outerStyle.Render(\"\")\n}\n```\n\nSimpler glow approach - enhance existing activeBorder:\n\n```go\nactiveBorder := func(w int, col FocusColumn) lipgloss.Style {\n    if w \u003c 2 {\n        w = 2\n    }\n\n    color := getActiveColor(col)\n\n    // Add subtle background glow\n    bgColor := lipgloss.Color(fmt.Sprintf(\"#%06x\",\n        0x1a0000 + // Very dark purple tint\n            uint32(color.Color)*0x10))\n\n    return lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n        BorderForeground(color).\n        Background(bgColor). // Subtle glow\n        Width(w - 2).\n        Height(listHeight - 2)\n}\n```\n\nNote: The above assumes color.Color field exists. Better approach:\n\n```go\nactiveBorder := func(w int, col FocusColumn) lipgloss.Style {\n    if w \u003c 2 {\n        w = 2\n    }\n\n    color := getActiveColor(col)\n\n    return lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n        BorderForeground(color).\n        Width(w - 2).\n        Height(listHeight - 2)\n}\n```\n\nFor true glow, would need lipgloss compositing. Save for future enhancement.\n\n### 4. Enhance Agent Status Visuals\n\n**File: `internal/ui/sidebar.go`**\n\nMake status dots pulse when running:\n\n```go\n// In renderAgentName\nfunc (m SidebarModel) renderAgentName(node *domain.SidebarNode, name string, isCursor bool) string {\n    if node.AgentInfo == nil {\n        return name\n    }\n\n    if m.shouldApplyStyle(isCursor) {\n        switch node.AgentInfo.Status {\n        case domain.AgentRunning:\n            // Pulsing dot for running agents\n            dot := \"●\"\n            // Could make dot pulse color if we had animation state in SidebarModel\n            return agentRunningStyle.Render(dot + \" \" + name)\n        case domain.AgentFailed:\n            // Failed: red dot\n            return agentFailedStyle.Render(\"● \" + name)\n        case domain.AgentCompleted:\n            return agentCompletedStyle.Render(\"● \" + name)\n        default:\n            return agentRunningStyle.Render(\"● \" + name)\n        }\n    }\n    return name\n}\n```\n\nAdd \"glitch\" effect for failed agents:\n\n```go\ncase domain.AgentFailed:\n    // Alternate between red and darker red for glitch effect\n    // Would need animation state for this\n    return agentFailedStyle.Render(\"⚠ \" + name)\n```\n\nUpdate agent status styles:\n\n```go\nagentRunningStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().\n    Foreground(lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"34\", Dark: \"34\"}).\n    Bold(true) // Make running agents stand out\n\nagentFailedStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().\n    Foreground(lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"160\", Dark: \"160\"}). // Bright red\n    Bold(true).\n    Blink(false) // Don't actually blink, just indicate urgency\n\nagentCompletedStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().\n    Foreground(lipgloss.AdaptiveColor{Light: \"245\", Dark: \"245\"}).\n    Italic(true) // Italic for \"done\" feel\n```\n\n### 5. Enhance Confirm View\n\n**File: `internal/ui/confirm.go`**\n\nAdd arcade-style ready indicator:\n\n```go\nvar (\n    // ... existing styles ...\n\n    readyBadgeStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Bold(true).\n        Foreground(lipgloss.Color(\"#ffffff\")).\n        Background(lipgloss.Color(\"#00ff00\")).\n        Padding(0, 2).\n        MarginBottom(1)\n\n    // Pulsing ready indicator\n    readyTextStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Bold(true).\n        Foreground(lipgloss.Color(\"#00ff00\")).\n        MarginBottom(1)\n)\n\nfunc confirmView(selection domain.Selection, renderer *config.Renderer, dryRun bool, workDir string) string {\n    s := \"\"\n\n    if dryRun {\n        s += dryRunBadgeStyle.Render(\"[DRY RUN]\") + \"\\n\"\n    }\n\n    s += titleStyle.Render(\"Confirm Launch Spec\") + \"\\n\"\n    // ... existing selection display ...\n\n    if workDir != \"\" {\n        s += fmt.Sprintf(\"WorkDir: %s\\n\\n\", itemStyle.Render(workDir))\n    }\n\n    // ... existing renderer output ...\n\n    // Arcade-style ready indicator\n    s += \"\\n\"\n    s += readyTextStyle.Render(\"READY?\")\n\n    s += \"\\n\"\n    s += \"[Press Enter to launch, esc to go back]\"\n    return s\n}\n```\n\nAdd big launch button visual:\n\n```go\nlaunchButtonStyle := lipgloss.NewStyle().\n    Bold(true).\n    Foreground(lipgloss.Color(\"#ffffff\")).\n    Background(lipgloss.Color(\"#d700d7\")).\n    Padding(0, 4).\n    MarginTop(1).\n    Width(20).\n    Align(lipgloss.Center)\n\n// At bottom:\ns += \"\\n\"\ns += launchButtonStyle.Render(\"LAUNCH\")\n```\n\n### 6.

Replace each sleep+action pair with a proper WaitFor that asserts on an observable state change after sending the key. Flaky on slow CI machines.\n\n2. **Weak/missing assertions in navigation tests**: TestTeatest_KeyboardNavigation_ArrowKeys and TestTeatest_FocusManagement_ColumnTransitions send key events but never assert any state change. After sending Right, assert focus changed (e.g., the harness list is now highlighted). Use tm.Send() then WaitFor() to verify an observable effect. Currently these tests are pure smoke tests with zero regression value.\n\n3. **Silent fallback in newTestAppWithHarnesses**: If NewApp returns an error, the function silently returns \u0026App{opts: opts} — a broken app struct — and tests run on it, potentially passing vacuously. Use require.NoError or t.Fatalf instead of the silent fallback.\n\n### agent_tui_test.go\n\n4. **startAgentTuiSession blocks on cmd.CombinedOutput()**: cmd.CombinedOutput() waits for the command to exit. 'agent-tui run' is a background session launcher that returns immediately with JSON. If it truly returns JSON and exits, the approach might work, but the context/cancel plumbing is wrong: cancel is stored in the session but is never the mechanism to stop the actual process (which has already exited). Verify the intended flow and either: (a) confirm 'agent-tui run --json' exits immediately after printing JSON (in which case, fix the misleading ctx/cancel/cmd.Process tracking) or (b) if it's a long-running process, use cmd.Start() + read stdout pipe instead.\n\n5. **TestAgentTui_GreyedOutColumns has no assertion**: hasGrey is computed but only logged (t.Logf), never asserted. This test always passes. Either assert True(t, hasGrey, ...) or document clearly (with a comment) why we cannot assert it yet (e.g., the feature isn't implemented and this is a canary test for when it is). As-is the test provides no value.\n\n6. **Ignored errors from agent-tui keyboard commands**: exec.Command(\"agent-tui\", \"press\", ...).Run() return values are silently dropped throughout. If agent-tui press fails (e.g., session not found, wrong key name), the test still passes. Capture and assert the error or at minimum t.Logf the stderr so failures are diagnosable.\n\n7. **connectWebsocket context lifetime**: ctx is created with WithTimeout and cancelled via defer cancel() inside the function, but the connection is returned and used after the context expires. WebSocket operations after ctx cancellation may fail unexpectedly. The context used for Dial should be separate from (or outlive) the connection's operating lifetime, or use context.Background() for the returned conn.\n\n8. **Stale binary caching in buildBlunderbust**: The cache check only looks for file existence (os.Stat), not staleness. If the binary exists from a previous test run but source has changed, the old binary is used. Add a modification-time check against the source or just always rebuild (the overhead is small for tests).","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-vpu","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Refinement: TUI Automated Testing (bb-q7u)","updated_at":"2026-02-28T12:02:29Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Add Lock-In Animation State\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_types.go`**\n\nExtend AnimationState:\n\n```go\ntype AnimationState struct {\n    pulsePhase      float64       // 0-1, sine wave for breathing\n    startTime       time.Time      // When animation started\n\n    // Lock-in flash state\n    lockInActive    bool           // True when flash is active\n    lockInIntensity float64       // 1.0 → 0.0, decays over time\n    lockInStartTime time.Time      // When flash started\n    lockInTarget   FocusColumn    // Which column was locked in\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add Lock-In Message\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_messages.go`**\n\n```go\n// lockInMsg is sent when a selection is locked in (Enter pressed)\ntype lockInMsg struct {\n    column FocusColumn\n}\n\n// lockInCmd creates a lock-in flash effect\nfunc lockInCmd(column FocusColumn) tea.Cmd {\n    return func() tea.Msg {\n        return lockInMsg{column: column}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update Animation Tick Handler\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_update.go`**\n\nModify handleAnimationTick:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) handleAnimationTick(msg animationTickMsg) (UIModel, tea.Cmd) {\n    elapsed := msg.time.Sub(m.animState.startTime).Seconds()\n\n    // Pulse cycle: 2.5 second period\n    period := 2.5\n    phase := (math.Sin(2*math.Pi*elapsed/period) + 1) / 2\n    m.animState.pulsePhase = phase\n\n    // Decay lock-in flash\n    if m.animState.lockInActive {\n        flashElapsed := msg.time.Sub(m.animState.lockInStartTime).Milliseconds()\n        // Flash lasts 48ms (3 frames at 60fps)\n        flashDuration := int64(48)\n\n        if flashElapsed \u003e= flashDuration {\n            // Flash complete\n            m.animState.lockInActive = false\n            m.animState.lockInIntensity = 0.0\n        } else {\n            // Linear decay: 1.0 → 0.0\n            m.animState.lockInIntensity = 1.0 - float64(flashElapsed)/float64(flashDuration)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return m, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Trigger Lock-In Flash on Selection\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_update.go`**\n\nModify handleKeyMsg (where Enter is processed):\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) handleKeyMsg(msg tea.KeyMsg) (UIModel, tea.Cmd, bool) {\n    switch msg.String() {\n    // ... existing key handling ...\n\n    case \"enter\":\n        // Trigger lock-in flash before handling selection\n        cmd := lockInCmd(m.focus)\n\n        // Then handle normal selection logic\n        var selectionCmd tea.Cmd\n        m, selectionCmd = m.handleEnter()\n\n        return m, tea.Batch(cmd, selectionCmd), true\n\n    // ... rest of keys ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEnsure handleEnter exists or create it if not:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) handleEnter() (UIModel, tea.Cmd) {\n    // Existing selection logic from current implementation\n    // Move this from switch case into separate function\n    // ... (extract existing Enter handling logic)\n    return m, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Flash Color Rendering\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_view.go`**\n\nAdd helper for lock-in flash color:\n\n```go\n// getFlashColor returns bright flash color based on intensity\nfunc getFlashColor(intensity float64) lipgloss.Color {\n    // Intensity: 1.0 (full bright) → 0.0 (normal)\n\n    if intensity \u003c= 0 {\n        return lipgloss.Color(\"\") // Use default\n    }\n\n    // Very bright magenta for flash\n    brightFlash := lipgloss.Color(\"201\") // Bright magenta\n    normalActive := ThemeActive\n\n    // For simplicity, return bright if intensity \u003e 0.5, else normal\n    // Proper implementation would blend colors\n    if intensity \u003e 0.5 {\n        return brightFlash\n    }\n    return normalActive\n}\n```\n\nModify activeBorder in renderMatrixView:\n\n```go\nfunc (m UIModel) renderMatrixView() string {\n    // ... existing guards ...\n\n    // Get base pulsing color\n    pulsingActiveColor := getPulsingColor(m.animState.pulsePhase)\n\n    // Check if lock-in flash is active for this column\n    getActiveColor := func(col FocusColumn) lipgloss.Color {\n        if m.animState.lockInActive \u0026\u0026 m.animState.lockInTarget == col {\n            return getFlashColor(m.animState.lockInIntensity)\n        }\n        return pulsingActiveColor\n    }\n\n    activeBorder := func(w int, col FocusColumn) lipgloss.Style {\n        if w \u003c 2 {\n            w = 2\n        }\n        return lipgloss.NewStyle().\n            Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n            BorderForeground(getActiveColor(col)).\n            Width(w - 2).\n            Height(listHeight - 2)\n    }\n\n    // Use activeBorder with column parameter\n    if m.focus == FocusTickets {\n        // ... existing code ...\n        tView = activeBorder(m.tWidth, FocusTickets).Render(capView(m.ticketList.View(), m.tWidth))\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    if m.focus == FocusHarness {\n        // ... existing code ...\n        hView = activeBorder(m.hWidth, FocusHarness).Render(capView(m.harnessList.View(), m.hWidth))\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // ... update Model and Agent sections similarly ...\n\n    // ... rest of renderMatrixView\n}\n```\n\nFull update for all columns:\n\n```go\n    if m.focus == FocusTickets {\n        m.ticketList.Title = focusIndicator + ticketTitle\n        tView = activeBorder(m.tWidth, FocusTickets).Render(capView(m.ticketList.View(), m.tWidth))\n        m.ticketList.Title = ticketTitle\n    } else {\n        m.ticketList.Title = noIndicator + ticketTitle\n        tView = inactiveBorder(m.tWidth).Render(faintCapView(m.ticketList.View(), m.tWidth))\n        m.ticketList.Title = ticketTitle\n    }\n\n    if m.focus == FocusHarness {\n        m.harnessList.Title = focusIndicator + harnessTitle\n        hView = activeBorder(m.hWidth, FocusHarness).Render(capView(m.harnessList.View(), m.hWidth))\n        m.harnessList.Title = harnessTitle\n    } else {\n        m.harnessList.Title = noIndicator + harnessTitle\n        hView = inactiveBorder(m.hWidth).Render(faintCapView(m.harnessList.View(), m.hWidth))\n        m.harnessList.Title = harnessTitle\n    }\n\n    if m.modelColumnDisabled {\n        // ... existing disabled code ...\n    } else if m.focus == FocusModel {\n        m.modelList.Title = focusIndicator + modelTitle\n        mView = activeBorder(m.mWidth, FocusModel).Render(capView(m.modelList.View(), m.mWidth))\n        m.modelList.Title = modelTitle\n    } else {\n        m.modelList.Title = noIndicator + modelTitle\n        mView = inactiveBorder(m.mWidth).Render(faintCapView(m.modelList.View(), m.mWidth))\n        m.modelList.Title = modelTitle\n    }\n\n    if m.agentColumnDisabled {\n        // ... existing disabled code ...\n    } else if m.focus == FocusAgent {\n        m.agentList.Title = focusIndicator + agentTitle\n        aView = activeBorder(m.aWidth, FocusAgent).Render(capView(m.agentList.View(), m.aWidth))\n        m.agentList.Title = agentTitle\n    } else {\n        m.agentList.Title = noIndicator + agentTitle\n        aView = inactiveBorder(m.aWidth).Render(faintCapView(m.agentList.View(), m.aWidth))\n        m.agentList.Title = agentTitle\n    }\n```\n\n### 6. Add Focus Transition Animation (Optional Enhancement)\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_types.go`**\n\nAdd to AnimationState:\n\n```go\ntype AnimationState struct {\n    // ... existing fields ...\n\n    // Focus transition\n    focusTransitionActive bool\n    focusTransitionFrom  FocusColumn\n    focusTransitionTo    FocusColumn\n    focusTransitionStart time.Time\n}\n```\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_messages.go`**\n\n```go\n// focusChangeMsg is sent when focus moves between columns\ntype focusChangeMsg struct {\n    from FocusColumn\n    to   FocusColumn\n}\n\nfunc focusChangeCmd(from, to FocusColumn) tea.Cmd {\n    return func() tea.Msg {\n        return focusChangeMsg{from: from, to: to}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate focus changes in Update to trigger transition:\n\n```go\n// In Update, when m.focus changes:\noldFocus := m.focus\n// ... logic that changes m.focus ...\nif oldFocus != m.focus {\n    return m, tea.Batch(cmd, focusChangeCmd(oldFocus, m.focus))\n}\n```\n\nHandle transition in tick:\n\n```go\n// In handleAnimationTick\nif m.animState.focusTransitionActive {\n    elapsed := msg.time.Sub(m.animState.focusTransitionStart).Milliseconds()\n    transitionDuration := int64(150) // 150ms transition\n\n    if elapsed \u003e= transitionDuration {\n        m.animState.focusTransitionActive = false\n    }\n    // Could interpolate border colors during transition\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Import Statements\n\n**File: `internal/ui/model_update.go`**\n\nNo new imports needed (already has time).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Pressing Enter triggers bright border flash (48ms duration)\n- [ ] Flash intensity decays smoothly to normal\n- [ ] Multiple rapid Enter presses each trigger separate flash\n- [ ] Flash does not interfere with pulse animation\n- [ ] Focus transitions feel responsive\n- [ ] Flash effect is satisfying without being distracting\n- [ ] All existing functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Tests pass\n\n## Notes\n\n- The 48ms flash duration is brief but noticeable (3 frames at 60fps)\n- Flash color should be very bright for impact\n- If focus transition is too complex, can skip it - lock-in flash is the priority\n- Consider adding lock-in flash to other selection points (sidebar, confirm view)\n- Flash effect is what gives the arcade \"button press\" feel\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: bb-cj8-anim-foundation (animation system must exist first)\n\n## Blocks\n\n- Color cycling (builds on lock-in mechanics)\n- Glow effects (builds on flash intensity system)\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bb-zuc","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"\"{}\"","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":3,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Lock-In Flash \u0026 Selection Feedback","updated_at":"2026-03-01T14:22:33Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
