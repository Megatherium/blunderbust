Connection mode is determined by .beads/metadata.json in the target project.\n- Embedded mode uses github.com/dolthub/driver — see tmp/store_embedded.go for reference patterns (DSN format, connector usage, pool config, backoff).\n- Server mode uses standard MySQL driver (github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) — see tmp/server-metadata.json for connection config shape.\n- The issues table schema is in tmp/schema.go. There's also a ready_issues view that filters for unblocked work.\n- This is READ-ONLY access. Blunderbuss never writes to the beads DB.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### internal/data/dolt/embedded.go\n- newEmbeddedStore(ctx, beadsDir) — opens embedded Dolt connection\n- Read .beads/metadata.json to get database name\n- DSN: file://\u003cabs_path_to_.beads/dolt\u003e?database=\u003cdb_name\u003e (read-only, no committer needed)\n- Connection pool: MaxOpenConns=1, MaxIdleConns=1 (embedded is single-connection)\n- Implements TicketStore.ListTickets using ready_issues view\n\n### internal/data/dolt/server.go\n- newServerStore(ctx, beadsDir) — opens MySQL connection to Dolt server\n- Read .beads/metadata.json for host, port, user, database\n- Standard MySQL DSN\n- Implements TicketStore.ListTickets using ready_issues view\n\n### internal/data/dolt/store.go\n- NewStore(ctx, beadsDir) — factory that reads metadata.json, picks embedded vs server mode\n- Shared query logic (both modes use same SQL, different *sql.DB)\n- ListTickets query: SELECT from ready_issues view, map to domain.Ticket\n- Filter support: status, issue_type, search (LIKE on title), limit\n\n### Metadata parsing\n- Parse .beads/metadata.json to determine mode (check dolt_mode or presence of server fields)\n- Current project's metadata.json: {database: dolt, backend: dolt, dolt_database: beads_bb} → embedded\n- Server example: adds dolt_mode: server, dolt_server_host, dolt_server_port, dolt_server_user\n\n### Unit tests\n- Metadata parsing (embedded detection, server detection)\n- Query building with filters\n- Use sqlmock for query tests (don't require running Dolt)\n\n### CLI integration\n- --beads-dir flag (default: .beads in current directory) to locate the beads database\n- DSN override via --dsn flag for manual connection strings\n\n## Key decisions\n- Read-only: no writes, no transactions, no locking concerns\n- Use ready_issues view for the default list (shows only unblocked, non-deferred, non-ephemeral)\n- Embedded mode requires CGO (dolthub/driver uses CGO) — document this in README\n- Fail loudly with actionable errors: DB not found, connection refused, schema mismatch","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"852741+Megatherium@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-19T18:46:42Z","created_by":"Megatherium","updated_at":"2026-02-19T18:46:42Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bb-2p9","depends_on_id":"bb-sxs","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T19:48:47Z","created_by":"Megatherium","metadata":"{}"}]}
{"id":"bb-3zg","title":"[FEATURE] One-shot tracer implementation","description":"### System Overview \u0026 Design Spec\nTo get from a Dolt database to a running tmux window, we need a clean pipeline. Here is the high-level architecture:\n#### 1. The Data Layer (Beads/Dolt)\nWe need to interface with the Dolt database used by Beads. Since Dolt is MySQL-compatible, we will use a standard Go SQL driver to query for:\n* **Tickets/Issues:** The active tasks you want to work on.\n* **Metadata:** Contextual info that might need to be passed to the harness (branch names, repo paths).\n#### 2. The Model Layer (Configuration)\nSince harnesses (OpenCode, Claude, etc.) change frequently, we should define them in a `config.yaml` or `config.json`. This maps a \"Harness\" to a specific shell command template.\nThe TicketID will be used in a work prompt,\n* **Attributes:** Name, Command Template (e.g., `opencode --model {{.Model}} --agent {{.Agent}}`), and supported Models/Agents.\n#### 3. The UI Layer (Bubble Tea)\nA multi-step TUI flow:\n* **List View:** Select a Ticket (filtered from Beads).\n* **Selection View:** Select Harness -\u003e Select Model -\u003e Select Agent (if applicable).\n* **Execution:** Confirm and Launch.\n#### 4. The Execution Layer (tmux/OS)\nThe Go binary will not just \"run\" a command; it will spawn a `tmux` window or pane.\n* **Command:** `tmux new-window -n \"Ticket-123\" \"harness_cmd_here\"`\n* **Tracking:** We can capture the window ID or PID if we want to monitor the process status later.\n---\n### Implementation Plan: Phase 1\nWe should start with a \"Minimum Viable Launcher\" that reads from the Dolt DB and triggers a tmux window.\n## Feature Description\nKeep this code nicely maintainable and extensible.
